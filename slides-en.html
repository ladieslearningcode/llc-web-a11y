        #What exactly *is* a website?

        A web**site** is made up of one or more web **pages**, and files (like images and HTML documents) organized in folders.

        The HTML & CSS code that we will be writing today will be interpreted by a web browser and presented to the user.

        Some people operate and experience the web in very different ways, but everyone deserves equal access the same information. That's what accessibility is all about!

        #What exactly *is* accessibility?

        You may have noticed the numeronym **a11y** used to describe accessibility<br>
        (a + 11 letters + y)

        ## Who are we taking into consideration?

        Persons who are visually impaired or blind, hard-of-hearing or Deaf, the elderly, non-native English speakers, users who have a cognitive disabilities or mobility impairments.

        This also affects those with temporary or situational disabilities, like a sprained wrist or dilated pupils for an eye exam.

        When we focus consciously on these needs, you'll start to realize we are actually just creating better websites for everybody!

        #Barriers

        A barrier is anything that keeps someone with a disability from fully participating in all aspects of society.

        **Attitude** is perhaps the most difficult barrier, but one that's completely within our power to change! Stereotypes form about people because of a lack of information.

        **Architectural** - communication barriers make it difficult to receive or convey information. Small print size, low colour contrast, confusing design and use of unclear language. Eg. if someone has colour blindness, they would struggle with low contrast

        #Barriers

        **Technology**, or lack of it, can prevent people from accessing information. Everyday tech tools can present barriers if they are not designed with accessibility in mind.

        **Systemic**, an organization's policies, practices and procedures that restrict people with disabilities, often unintentionally. Eg. if someone is deaf, are there is no closed captions available

        #Shared responsibility

        A website could be built by 1 person, but typically a group of people build a website or application together.

        There are many roles involved: **web/UI/UX designers**, **web developers**, **engineers**, **copywriters**, **project managers**, **subject matter consultants**, **SEO experts**, **content translators**, etc.

        Everyone involved in a web project has a different role to play when it comes to creating an accessible product. It's a group effort and **everyone is responsible** for ensuring the end product is compliant with any local legislation.

        #Plan ahead of time

        Ideally, before a web project begins, accessibility is taken into account during the initial planning phases.

        Imagine building an entire home, and finding out once the home is built that the hallways are not wide enough to accommodate an adult sized wheelchair. Now, it will be much more costly to rip apart what you've already built, when you could have made those measurements before-hand. The same is true for products built on code. **Accessibility as an after-thought becomes costly and time consuming**.

        That being said, an already existing site can be improved upon. This is where accessibility checker tools come in handy. You can assess an existing site to identify problems, and come up with a plan on how to fix them.

        #How it applies to the web - WCAG

        WCAG - **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**

        * Provides a set of international standards to keep the internet accessible to *everyone*
          * there are different levels - A, AA, or AAA
        * Guidelines were developed by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/).
        * AODA is the only provincial act that requires compliance with WCAG

        The goal isn't "all or nothing" — every improvement you are able to make will help the cause

        WCAG is based upon 4 principles: **perceivable, operable, understandable**, and **robust**. Let's examine each of these principles...

        #Accessing websites and web pages

        When we want to view a specific page on a website, we provide a URL to the browser to determine *how* and *where* to find the files:

        ```xml
        https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/about/
        ```

        We're going to be working on a file stored on our computer, which will look something like this:

        ```xml
        file:///C:/Users/YourName/Desktop/llc-web-a11y-master/project-en/index.html

        #More about URLs

        URLs typically contain the following pieces:

        - `scheme` - This tells the browser *how* to find the file.
        - `host` - This is the name of the website itself. It tells the browser *generally* where the file can be found (kind of like a home address).
        - `path` - This tells the browser *specifically* where the file can be found. If the `host` is the home address, the `path` is the name of the person we're looking for, and which room they're in!

        ```xml
        <scheme>//<host>/<path>/
        ```

        #Demo - Using a Screen Reader

        Walking through your site with a screen reader can help you identify barriers and indicate where pitfalls may exist.

        > It's important to remember that we can never fully emulate what it is like to experience the web in the same way a user with a visual impairment would. You may find using the screen reader difficult, intimidating and frustrating, especially if the site you are testing is not built with accessibility in mind.

        1. In the learner files, open the `demo-site` folder and open the `index.html` page. Scan the site as you normally would - try to clicking on some links and navigate the menu.
        2. Check the volume on your laptop. Turn it up just loud enough for you to hear it
        3. Start up your screen reader and use the commands on the next slide to try and navigate the website using only your keyboard. You can continue to look at your monitor, or try looking away from your monitor to focus on what is being read to you.

        #HTML: The content layer

        Tags usually come in pairs &mdash; an opening tag and a closing tag &mdash; to *wrap* the content.  Note the closing tag has a forward slash (`/`).

        ```
        <tag> opening tag --- closing tag </tag>
        ```

        HTML *tags* describe the content inside of them to the web browser or assistive technologies.
        ```
        <h1>This tag describes a heading</h1>
        <p>This tag is for paragraphs.</p>

        ```
        <outertag>outer content <innertag>inner content</innertag> outer content</outertag>
        ````

        Nested tags create a family tree-like relationship, often referred to as *parent* and *child* nodes.

        The inner tag is the child of the outer tag.

        ```
        <parent>
          <child></child>

        But for us, using whitespace through indentation (tabs) will makes HTML easier to read. When nesting a tag, add one tab space.

        1. In the text editor, open `index.html` (**File** > **Save**)
        1. In *between* the `<title></title>` tags, add a *page title* that reflects the content of your webpage. Example:
          ```
          <title>Laura Ipsum | Digital Designer & Developer</title>
          ```
        1. Open `index.html` in the browser.
          * go to Windows Explorer or Finder
          * navigate to the **llc-a11y-master > project** folder
          * double click on **index.html** to open it in your default browser
          <br><span class="note">(If Chrome is not your default, right-click/two-finger tap on **index.html** and choose **Open With > Chrome**)</span>
        1. Edit the content between any of the other HTML tags to customize the content on the page. Remember to save your changes in the text editor, and then refresh the web browser.

        #HTML5 Structural Elements

        HTML5 introduced new tags to better describe blocks of content such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` and `<section>`. There are many more.

        **Good for SEO** — search engines prioritize keywords used in headings and links, than keywords included in non-semantic tags like a `<div>`, so your site is more *indexable*

        **Good for  reader users** - screen readers read those tags out as the user progresses through the content, notifying them what is a header, footer, etc.

        #Headings

        HTML heading tags define the main subjects throughout the page.

        Heading tags range from `<h1>` to `<h6>` used to describe the *hierarchy* of the page structure. To decide which heading to use, think about how you would arrange an essay outline.

        ```xml
        <h1>Types of Apples</h1>
        <h2>Red varieties</h2>
        <h3>Fuji apple</h3>

        #Headings

        Most screen readers allow you to skip through all headings on the page - like a table of contents - to find specific content.

        The order of headings is important as it allows non-visual users (and search engine bots) to understand the importance and hierarchy of content on the page. Heading levels should not be skipped!

        #Paragraphs

        **Paragraphs**: whether it&#39;s one sentence or more, each paragraph needs its own pair of `<p></p>` tags:

        ```xml
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        <p>This is a longer paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Non vero dolor expedita quasi reiciendis minus unde sapiente id eveniet saepe officia quibusdam aspernatur, sint voluptate ipsam ex magni. Aliquam, ex!</p>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Paragraphs

        If you need to start text on a new line, you can use the self-closing `<br>` tag. That means no closing `</br>` tag is necessary:

        ```xml
        <p>129 Spadina ave<br>
        Toronto, ON<br>
        M5V 2L3</p>
        ```

        However, we could use a different tag in this example! There is an HTML tag for `address`:


        ```xml
        <address>129 Spadina ave<br>
        Toronto, ON<br>
        M5V 2L3</address>
        ```

        >Do you have an address on your project page? If you do, use the `<address>` tag instead of the generic `<p>` tag.

        #Tips for writing content on the web

        Before you start writing content for your website, create a list of potential keywords that your potential user could use to search for your webpage.

        * What services/products do you offer?
        * Where do you offer them?
        * Analyze your competition to see what wording they use

        Once you have that list of words, **use those words in your content**! Search engines like Google will scrape the text content as part of its process to rank your site in search results.

        # Hyperlinks

        A hyperlink references data, such as a web page or document, that the user can follow.

        Use the anchor tag, `<a>` to create the link. It also needs an `href` attribute to provide information for the location of the resource.

        The example below includes an *absolute* path to the Ladies Learning Code homepage.

        Link text should describe its purpose and destination. If you read the link on its own, without the paragraph surrounding it, it should be clear where you will go.

        Rather than this:

        ```xml
        <a href="files/annual-report.pdf">Click here</a> to read our annual report.

        do this:

        #Paths

        Some of the content we see on a webpage lives directly within the page itself (ie. the text), but some of it may live elsewhere (eg. in the images folder, on another website, etc.).

        When we want to display some content that lives *outside* of the current page, we have to tell the browser where to find it. This information is called a `path`.

    <section class="slide project" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Types of Paths

        Paths allow the browser to find, retrieve, and display external resources such as images, CSS files, and even other web pages.

        There are two different types of paths:

        * `Relative` - These tell the browser how to get from the current page to the external resource.
        * `Absolute` - These tell the browser *exactly* where the external resource can be found online.

        If relative paths are like directions, an absolute path is like a home address.

        #Relative Paths

        **We use relative paths when we're trying to make a connection between two resources on the same website.**

        Relative paths start from the location of the current page, and tell the browser which folders should be looked in to find the external resource.

        ```xml
        images/backgrounds/dark/dark-background-1.jpg
        ```

        Notice the relative paths used in the `img` tags in your project.

        http://website.com/images/image-1.jpg

        // CSS
        https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.css
        ```

        Absolute paths start with a protocol (ie. `http` or `https`), followed by the location of the resource. It's usually not necessary to include the `www` before the domain.

        #Images: Self-closing tags

        Self-closing tags don't format content or require a closing tag. They are used to embed objects onto the page; they *are* the content!

        Images use a self-closing tag. It also requires the `src` *attribute* to tell the browser the location of the image file.

        ```
        <img src="images/image-file.jpg">

        ```

        `alt` is another attribute that is added to images to provide *alternative text* which is ready by screen readers.

        ```
        <img src="images/image-file.jpg" alt="kitten">

        ```

        The `alt` attribute is also helpful when image does not load:

        #Tips for writing good alt Text

        * Should be short and succinct
        * Should not include the words “image of” or “photo of” - the screen reader will indicate that this element is an image when it comes across the `img` tag.
          * Words like “illustration of” or “diagram of” can help provide context
        * If the image itself has text in it, like a logo, the `alt` text *must* include that text!

        If the image is simply decorative but serves no practical value, you can leave the `alt` attribute empty. To comply with WCAG standards, the `alt` attribute **must** be present, but if it is left empty, the screen reader will ignore it.

        ```
        <img src="images/decorative.jpg" alt="">

        ```

        Want to link an image? Describe the link in the image's alt text.

        #Class Exercise - Embed a YouTube Video

        Video is another great medium to convey information on a webpage, but comes with its own considerations when it comes to accessibility. We already have a video on our page! Let's replace it with a new one that relates to the content of your website.

        1. Go to [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/) and choose a video that you want to insert into your webpage. <small>Please note that some videos may be blocked for embedding on a webpage for users in Canada. You will see an error message if that is the case.</small>
        1. Click on the share button below the video
        <img alt="share video icon" src="framework/img/workshop/video-share.png" width="600"/>
        1. Choose the embed option<br>
        <img alt="share video icon" src="framework/img/workshop/video-embed.png" width="400"/>
        1. Copy the HTML code provided
        1. In Atom, paste the code in your `index.html` file to replace the existing `iframe` code.
        1. Save your changes and refresh the browser to see your video in action!

        Captions are text versions of audio content synchronized with video. They’re crucial for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and can also be helpful for non-native English speakers.

        1. Let's add one attribute to the `iframe` code first. We'll use the attribute `title`, and use the video title in YouTube as the value. This'll let the user know what the video is about before they watch it. It'll look like this:
        ```
        <iframe title="Styles of yoga" width="560" height="315".../>
        ```
        1. Create a plain text file and name it `transcript.txt` in the root folder of your project (a sibling to the `index.html` file). Type out at least the first few sentences of audio in the video that you've selected.
        1. Add a hyperlink (`a` tag) in your `index.html` directly below the `iframe` code from Youtube that links to your transcript file. (Refer to slide #59 for relative paths).
        1. Personalize more of the content if you have extra time.

font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
font-weight: normal;
font-size: 2rem;
line-height: 1.25;
text-transform: lowercase;</textarea>

        <div id="css-type" class="example">
          <p>Just some text to test out the above styles. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Magni repellat sunt quae fugit illum in aut sed, quis nesciunt totam veritatis, dolores alias modi fuga commodi dicta facilis, consequatur temporibus.</p>

        #What is `rem` and `em`?

        `rem` and `em` are units of measure, like `px` or `%`.
        `em` is a proportion of the inherited font size of an element, and `rem` is relative to the document's font size.

        Try playing with the demo below to see how relative font sizes work:
        <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#css-rel-units">.parent {
            font-size: 10px;
          }
          .child {
            font-size: 2em;
          }</textarea>

        <div id="css-rel-units" class="example parent">
          <p>My font size is 10px!</p>
          <p class="child">
            My font size is 2 × 10px, which is 20px!
          </p>
        </div>

        The default `font-size` applied to the document is usually around 16 pixels, which means the two lines below will have the same result in most browsers:
        ```
        font-size: 1rem;
        font-size: 16px;
        ```

        Relative units are quite useful — you can size your HTML elements relative to your font or viewport size, so that the layout will still look correct if, for example, the text size is doubled across the whole website by a visually impaired user.

        #Tips for accessible typography

        * Use at least a 12-point font on all Web pages
          * Adjust the `line-height` to ensure there is a decent amount of space between lines of text. A `line-height` that is too small will cause text to overlap, but a line-height that is too high can be difficult to read.
        * Never rely on colour alone to indicate behaviour - for example, hyperlinks should be underlined
          * Use `text-decoration: underline;` in your stylesheet to underline. What would you use as the selector to apply this to links?

        #font-family and Web safe fonts

        When using the `font-family` property, it's best practice to list at least two or three fonts. If the user doesn't have the first font installed on their device, the next option is used instead.

        ```
        body {
          font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        ```

        Fonts that are considered *web safe* are fonts that are commonly installed on most computers.

        Here's a listing of web safe fonts: [CSS Font Stack](http://cssfontstack.com/).

        #Web Fonts

        When using webfonts, as long as the user is connected to the internet, they do not need to have the font installed in order to see it displayed on a webpage.

        Services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) (free) and [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) (free & paid) make it easier to add variety, without relying on fonts the user already has installed.

        We'll be using Google Fonts in today's project.

          * The LLC project uses normal 400 for all three fonts.
          * The default character set should contain what you need.
        1. Choose **Embed** to get the code:
          * copy the `<link>` code snippet
          * add it to the `<head>` of **all** your HTML pages. <span class="note">(Make sure to add the link *before* your the *styles.css* file)</span>

        #Class Exercise #4: Applying colours and typography

        Now that you've chosen colours that satisfy our contrast requirements, let's put them to use!

        1. Using the CSS `background` property, change the colour of your `body`, `section` or `footer` tags. Refer <a href="#slide85">back to slide 85</a> for the syntax!
        2. Using the `color` property, change the text colour. You can select all tags of a type, like `p`, `a` or `li`. Ask a mentor to select something more specific, like only paragraphs in the footer!
        3. Change other font styles like `font-size`, `font-weight`, `text-transform` or `text-align`.

        # The Box Model

        The CSS **Box Model** describes the way CSS determines the size and spacing of HTML elements. To the browser, every HTML element is a rectangular / square box.

        In the current project HTML document, the red lines in the example below represent the outlines of all the elements.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/box-borders-example.jpg" alt="box elements with borders" style="width: 650px">

        Note the spacing between the elements on your page such as the headings and paragraphs. That's the default `margin` and `padding` for those elements applied by your browser.

    <section class="slide nested-list" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # The Box Model

        There are 5 CSS properties used to determine size and spacing.

        ![Box Model example](framework/img/workshop/box-model-layout.jpg)<!-- .element: class="left" -->

        * **width** - can set a specific width
        * **height** - can set a specific height
        * **margin** - adds/removes space around the element
        * **padding** - adds/removes space inside of the element
        * **border** - adds a border just outside of the element

        #Margin and Padding

        The values for both `margin` and `padding` can be declared using 1 to 4 values, to target different sides of the element. A variety of measurement units (px, %, ems, rems, etc) can be used.

        Setting the value to "0" will *remove* any default space and any positive value will *add* space. Margin can also use negative values. Padding cannot.

        Both margin and padding can also used the longhand property to target a specific side:
        ```css
        margin-top: 2px;
        margin-right: 2px;
        margin-bottom: 2px;
        margin-left: 2px;
        ```

        ```css
        padding-top: 2px;
        padding-right: 2px;
        padding-bottom: 2px;

        1. Add some padding to the `.button` selector to make room around the text and the background colour
        1. Try adding a border to the button in a different colour than the background

        So far, we've been using `background` to add colours, but it can also be used to add background *images*.

        There are two ways to declare the `background` property:

        ```css
        /* shorthand */
        background: url(folder-name/image-file.jpg);
        ```
        ```css
        /* longhand */
        background-image: url(folder-name/image-file.jpg);
        ```
        `background` is shorthand for many different background properties. Using a shorthand property, you can write more concise style sheets, saving time and energy.

        background: url(../images/image-file.jpg);
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Background Property

        If the image is smaller than the width of your browser window, it will repeat by default. We can change that with the `no-repeat` value like this:

        ```
        body { /* longhand */
          background-image: url(../images/kitten.jpg);
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
        }
        ```
        ```
        body { /* shorthand */
          background: url(../images/kitten.jpg) no-repeat;
        }
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Class Exercise #7: background

        Copy and paste the code below into your CSS file, one value at a time, to see how each property works.

        ```
        body { /* longhand */
          background-image: url('../images/profile.jpg');
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
          background-attachment: fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```
        ```
        body { /* shorthand */
          background: url(../images/profile.jpg) no-repeat fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```

        ---
        ###Pro tip!

        Note that `background-size` is the longhand property. To include it in the shorthand style, it **must** be included after `background-position`, separated with the `/` character. In this case, it may be less error prone to just add it via the longhand property.

        #Opaque background Styles

        The background images adds some pizzazz, but now it's a little hard to read the text!

        Every time an HTML element is nested, the elements are stacked in layers, kind of like a sandwich!

        ![](framework/img/workshop/css-z-index.png)

        Let's look at the HTML of our header:

        ```
        <header>
          <h1>Yoga Studio</h1>
          <h2>Drop-in classes, workshops and retreats for all levels</h2>
        </header>
        ```

        Our background image is the layer behind, and the headings are the layer infront.

        We need to add a new layer in-between the text and the background, and apply a slightly transparent colour to improve the contrast. Let's break it down step-by-step.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #in-class exercise: Background styles & the z-axis

        Use `rgba()` to create a translucent background. The values must be declared using this syntax:

        ```css
        rgba(r value, g value, b value, alpha transparency percentage)
        ```
        ```css
        background: rgba(97, 41, 64, 0.95);
        ```
        The closer to 1 the alpha transparency value is, the more solid the colour will appear.
        Use [this tool](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hex-to-rgb.html) to change a #hex code to its equivalent RGB value.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      #in-class exercise: Background styles & the z-axis

       1. In your **index.html**, wrap the text in a `<div>` with a class of `text`.
       2. Add a new `<div>` to act as the in-between layer with a class of `overlay`. It will look something like this:

      ```
      <header>
        <div class="text">
          <h1>Yoga Studio</h1>
          <h2>Drop-in yoga classes and retreats for all levels</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="overlay"></div>
      </header>
      ```

      In your CSS, add the following lines:

      ```
      header {
        position: relative;
      }
      .overlay{
        background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6); /* 60% white */
        /* play around with the colour or percentage above */
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        position: absolute;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        z-index: 1;
      }
      .text{
        position: relative;
        z-index: 2;
      }
      ```

      <small>In order to apply a `z-index`, we need to also use the CSS property `position`. This goes beyond the scope of what we can cover today, but you can read more about it here:</small>

      You now have a functional and beautiful website! Let's try using the screen reader again on **our** site now and see how easy it is to navigate! Refer <a href="#slide28">back to slide 28</a> for the screen reader commands.

      If you have time, you can try downloading the [WAVE webaim extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh). This is similar to the website we used in an earlier exercise, but can be used to test local files.
      In order to get this working on local files, you need to turn this setting on:

        #Be an advocate for accessibility

        **Legal Argument:** UN Convention on the rights of people with disabilities. Access to communications and technology is a basic human right.

        **Technical Argument:** By creating accessible websites, you're building upon a responsive, adaptive platform that can serve you well in other areas.

        **Market Argument:** The market of people with disabilities is huge, and growing as the population ages. People with disabilities have a trillion dollar income, with 200b in discretionary income.

        **Humanitarian Argument:** You can reach brilliant, innovative users who would not be supported or realize their potential otherwise.
